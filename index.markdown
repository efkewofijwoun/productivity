## Focus of Project Work

Our project work is based off the modernization of the world, how these modernizations have affected us for the better or for worse
We chose to research on students of SJI, and how they had been positively affected or negatively affected by the entertainment technology we used. 
Entertainment technologies are a common tool in our lives but are often considered, damaging to oneâ€™s productivity. Our group wanted to find out whether this point is actually true, thus coming up with this project and topic to research about.

## Our Aims

Our aim for the project was to see if technology with entertainment value would lead to productivity within SJI students. 

Leading us to craft our 
Thesis question: Has technology that has entertainment value made most SJI students more productive than when they are deprived of entertainment?
Hypothesis: If entertainment technology is used is excess, it will result in unproductivity

Based of these points we went and crafted our questions for our survey.
