## Conclusion
Entertainment technologies cause students to be less productive

## Data
![Time](/assets/how-long.png)
> Studnets spend around 4hs on entertainment per day which averages to around 45hs per week

![Spent](/assets/spent.png)
> Students in general do their homework after spending time on entertainment technologies

![Productive](/assets/productive.png)
> Students generally think they are relatively productive rating themselves 7 out of 10 

![entertainment](/assets/entertainment.png)
> Students generally do homework/revision after using entertainment technologies.

## How we evaluated productivity

### Method 
We used a online survey to send out our question to receive responses from different students.

In this dangerous time of Covid-19, may meet-ups were disbanded and students are advised to not meet up with each other and even avoid contact if possible, to reduce the spread this pandemic.  This was our main reason to send out an online survey compared to personally interviewing students.
Secondly, with online surveys, students were able to fill in the survey at their own pace, compared to being approach by a group when they might be in a rush. 
This had also allowed us to reduce our survey to certain students, those who use technology in their free time, suggesting that they were more likely be known to use these entertainment technology, allowing us to filter through survey easily

### Sample
We choose to do an online survey, and had no real-life location, but since our thesis question was based off students in SJI, we had sent this out to all students in the school, which allowed us to take in different responses in different age groups and would thus be able to see if it had a play in their productivity when using entertainment technology, but thankfully it did not.
Our sample size was 80 students, which were spanned from different age groups, making sure than age was not affecting productivity when using entertainment technology. This sample size was larger than our group expected and was good,  as it made our results more precise.

## Secondary Data

Based on [https://www.oecd.org/education/highlights.pdf](https://www.oecd.org/education/highlights.pdf) we found out that, Singapore students aced global benchmarking tests conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2012, including the test on digital skills. 

Also, based on [https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Children-digital-technology-wellbeing.pdf]9https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Children-digital-technology-wellbeing.pdf), spending too much time on these technologies can also negatively impact their mental well-being.

## How we evaluated productivity

The formula for productivity was modelled as n/t where n is the total points of the person and t is the amount of time spent on the work including the breaks

For the questions, we found out the amount of work they did and the amount of time they spent on those tasks. We create a point system out of 10 points in order to judge the productivity of each individual, such as doing generic homework awards you 6 points, doing test papers 8 points.

We then took the total amount of points and plotted it by the amount of minutes spent on the entertainment technology to calculate the productivity of these SJI students.

We found students got a total of 8-7 points for productivity while spending at around 1-1.5h on entertainment technology.
Secondly, students got a total of 6-5 points for productivity while spending at around 3-4h on entertainment technology.
Lastly, students got a total of 3-2 points for productivity while spending at around 6-7h on entertainment technology.

## Reasoning
It eats up a lot of time for students.
Based on [https://www.budgetdirect.com.sg/car-insurance/research/public-transport-singapore](https://www.budgetdirect.com.sg/car-insurance/research/public-transport-singapore), Singaporeans spend an average of 84 mins on commuting during weekdays. This leaves them little time to study and do homework with the additional 4 hours spend on entertainment every day, making their day little to not at all productive.
